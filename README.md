A New Focus for the W3C: Improving the Web’s Integrity

# Introduction
The World Wide Web was conceived more than 25 years ago as a tool for sharing information. It has become much more than that; it is a fundamental part of the lives of much of humanity, enabling access to information, education, commerce and shopping, social experiences, civic functions, entertainment, and more. 

The Web is a force for good; indeed, it has catalyzed major social changes. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society: openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud. Ease of gathering personal information spawned business models that mined and sold detailed user behaviors, without people’s awareness or consent. The acceleration of global information sharing enabled misinformation to flourish, be exploited for political or commercial gain, divide societies, and incite hate.  We must do better.  We must take steps to address these unintended consequences in the standards we develop.

The W3C must task itself with improving the Web platform's fundamental integrity, while the Web continues to grow in scope and importance in our lives.  

# Our Values

We believe in these core values of the Web:

* The Web is for all humanity.
* The Web is designed for the good of its users.
* The Web must be safe for its users.
* There is one interoperable world-wide Web.

# Our Principles

The W3C itself must function with these strategic principles:

* Put the needs of users first: above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity.
* Ensure transparency, equity and fairness. Our work should not be exclusively dominated by any person, company or interest group.
* Ensure that the Web can work for everyone, striving for diversity and inclusion of participants from different geographical locations, cultures, languages, accessibility needs, gender identities, and more. Continue to champion accessibility and internationalization as core principles for the Web.
* Make the web trustworthy, by improving security and privacy for users. We must revisit the current Web platform and explore how we can responsibly improve personal privacy for users. 
* Ensure the Web does not favor centralization. 
* Drive interoperability across vendors and implementations using open test suites, a strong patent policy and open licenses
* Encourage incubation in new areas and industries with open platforms for discussion, collaboration and innovation

# Our Purpose: Focusing on the Integrity of the Web

We believe the W3C's purpose is to:

*	Provide an open forum for discussions for organizations of all sizes (from single-person companies to multi-nationals).
*	Ensure that standards are developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders.
*	Maintain and develop a unified Web architecture, which continues to address evolving use cases.
* Build and maintain respected relationships with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.

# Strategic Goals
* Ensure efforts on accessibility and internationalization continue to achieve the goal of a Web for everyone.
* Ensure that the evolving Web platform and Web technologies improve in integrity, security and privacy.
* Evolve the extensible web architecture to empower industries and individuals to address the evolving user’s needs.
* Improve efforts on new technology incubation, making it more structured and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.
* Achieve worldwide participation, diversity and inclusion, establishing W3C as representative of the worldwide community.
* Further improve the environment for facilitating balance, equity and cooperation among the participating organizations and user groups from different industries and sizes.
* Increase involvement of under-represented key stakeholders such as end users, content creators, developers etc.
* Establish and improve collaborative relationships with other organizations in the domain of Internet and Web standards.

# Identity
The global brand of the W3C should be centered around the following:
* We are an open forum where diverse voices from around the world and industries come together, incubate and build consensus for global standards for Web technologies.
* We are socially responsible and committed to ensure that the Web is for everyone; we greatly emphasize accessibility, internationalization, privacy, security and diversity.
* We are committed to developing open and royalty-free standards with high focus on interoperability and collective empowerment.
