A New Focus: Improving the Web’s Integrity

# Introduction
The World Wide Web was conceived more than 25 years ago as a tool for sharing information. It has become much more than that; it is a fundamental part of the lives of much of humanity, enabling access to information, commerce and shopping, social experiences, civic functions, entertainment, and more. 

We have treated the Web as a force for good; and indeed it has catalyzed major social changes. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society: openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud. Ease of gathering personal information spawned business models that mined and sold detailed user behaviors, without people’s awareness or consent. The acceleration of global information sharing enabled misinformation to flourish, be exploited for political or commercial gain, divide societies, and incite hate.  We must do better.

The W3C must task itself with improving the Web platform's fundamental integrity, while the Web continues to grow in scope and importance in our lives.  
# Our Values

We believe in these core values of the Web:

* the Web is for all humanity
* the Web is designed for the good of its users
* the Web must be safe for its users
* there is one interoperable world-wide Web

# Our Principles

The W3C itself must function with these strategic principles:

* Put the needs of users first: above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity
* Ensure that the Web can work for everyone, striving for diversity and inclusion of participants from different geographical locations, cultures, languages, accessibility needs, gender identities, and more. Continue to champion accessibility and internationalization as core principles for the Web.
* Make the web trustworthy, by improving security and privacy for users. We must revisit the current Web platform and explore how to responsibly improve personal privacy for users.
* Drive interoperability across vendors and implementations using open test suites, a strong patent policy and open licenses
* Encourage incubation in new areas and industries with open platforms for discussion, collaboration and innovation

# Our Purpose: Focusing on the Integrity of the Web

*	Provide an open forum for discussions for organizations of all sizes (from single person company to multinationals.
*	Ensure that standards are developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders
*	Maintain and develop the unified web architecture, which continues to address evolving use cases.
*   Build and maintain respected relationships with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.

This vision of who we are and our shared organizational values must move into strategic conversations about who we serve, how we serve them, and with whom we partner.
