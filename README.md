A New Focus: Improving the Web’s Integrity

# Introduction
The World Wide Web was conceived more than 25 years ago as a tool for sharing information. It has become much more than that; it is a fundamental part of the lives of much of the planet, enabling access to information, commerce & shopping, social experiences, civic functions, entertainment, and more. 

We have treated the Web as a force for good; and indeed it has catalyzed major social changes. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society: openness & anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud. Ease of gathering personal information spawned business models that mined & sold detailed user behaviors, without people’s awareness or consent. The acceleration of global information sharing enabled misinformation to flourish, be exploited for political or commercial gain, divide societies, and incite hate.  We must do better.

The W3C must task itself with improving the Web platform's fundamental integrity, while the Web continues to grow in scope and importance in our lives.  

# Our values

We believe in these core values of the Web itself:

* the Web is for all humanity
* the Web is designed for the good of its users
* the Web must be safe for its users
* there is one world-wide Web

# Our Principles: Focusing on the Integrity of the Web

Our core principles to support these values are:

* putting the needs of users first: above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity; a priority of constituencies built on the excellent work from the [TAG's Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/).
* ensuring that the Web can work for everyone, striving for diversity & inclusion of participants from different geographical locations, cultures, languages, accessibility needs, gender identities, and more.
* championing of fundamentals: accessibility, internationalization, security, and privacy, including revisiting the current Web platform and exploring how to responsibly improve personal privacy for users.

We will act on these principles by:
* consensus-building and fostering mutual respect and technical coordination across borders, industries, and organizations around the world
* driving interoperability across vendors and implementations using open test suites
* fostering collaboration and interoperability with a strong patent policy and open licenses
* encouraging incubation in new areas & industries with platforms for discussion, collaboration and innovation
* building and maintaining respected relationships with governments & businesses for providing credible advice.

This vision of who we are and our shared organizational values must move into strategic conversations about who we serve, how we serve them, and with whom we partner.

# Principles

*	Provide an open forum for discussions for organizations of all sizes (from single person company to multinationals.
*	Ensure that standards are developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders
*	Maintain and develop the unified web architecture, which continues to address evolving use cases.

How did we get here and where is here?

## History: Inventing the Web Platform - 1995 to 2005
For the first 10 years or so, members of the W3C were working together to invent an open platform that used the internet protocols to share information to all humanity. We figured out what technologies from various existing (often proprietary) systems could be made to work via HTTP, how they might fit together, and which ones really got real world traction. We:

* Chose the best of ideas from early browsers, SGML editors, academic hypertext systems, word-processing products;
* incorporated scripting language support to make it customizable and dynamic;
* incorporated stylesheets to separate content from presentation;
* experimented with ways of integrating Web apps with databases and enterprise applications;
* built a broad community and deep expertise dedicated to ensuring the web is both accessible and international.

By 2005 or so the overall architecture was fairly clear, though curation of the HTML specification had moved to WHATWG. HTTP serving HTML, CSS, DOM, and Javascript became the core technologies for the Web. Other technologies such as XML, RDF, XSLT, Java/VB, and SOAP remain relevant and viable in some (often large) niches and enterprise-scale applications, but have not become part of the core Web platform.

## History: Making the Web Platform Solid, Open, Interoperable - 2006 to 2019
Once the W3C and other open communities had proved the Web's potential, businesses, governments, and users around the world began to depend on it. However, the Web struggled with many of the details:

* under-specified and incompletely-implemented formats and APIs limited interoperability;
* the mobile Web platform took off and created many new technology challenges, but the core web and engines supporting it failed to adapt quickly;
* browser engines and clients evolved rapidly but unevenly;
* entertainment and commerce over-took knowledge creation and sharing as the most common use case for the Web;
* rapid change and business considerations led to confusion about what really was a "standard".

The businesses which depended on the Web generally believed that they spent too much developer time just making their websites work across the range of devices and browsers their customers used. A significant number of major IT, telecom, entertainment, and other businesses have thought it good business to invest in the W3C to help make the Web platform work better. W3C and WHATWG agreed on the curation and publication of HTML.

## The Present: Our Situation
We have treated the Web as only a force for good, and indeed it has catalyzed major social changes. We are proud of the positive changes: e-commerce, publishing, instant access to facts, social engagement, entertainment. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society:

* Its openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud.
* It is too easy to gather personal information, unknown to users: business models that support "free" access to web resources mostly depend on collecting detailed personal information on users without their knowledge, performing exploitive surveillance. The wealth of content funded by these models are a public good; the loss of personal privacy and higher barriers to understanding are not.
* By accelerating the easy exchange of information around the globe, it has enabled misinformation to flourish and be exploited for political or commercial gain;
lack of diversity in participation at the W3C has undoubtedly led to [biases in specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias).

In addition, the successes of the Web don't ensure that members will keep supporting the W3C to perform its functions. Far from there being a need to convince people of the value of the Web, it has become ["too big to fail."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail) The Web is a clear public good, and sometimes suffers from the problem that its maintenance and development are taken as a given, and fewer organizations can economically justify investing their time and expertise in improving the platform for everyone else.

The consortium must become much more conscious of its role, more careful to analyze the unintended effects and consequences of the specifications it publishes, and the technologies they support. We must investigate and address security problems. We must ensure that privacy is universally valued. We must ensure the Web does not favor centralization. The W3C has long unevenly participated in places where regulation and technology meet, and our duty to inform public debate and regulation has expanded: we must establish a forum to discuss and publish technical considerations on social issues. The W3C must look more carefully at our contribution to major challenges facing humanity, particularly sustainable development.  We must be conscious of our constituencies and their priorities, and we must be explicit about the resulting values and principles. We must continue to expand the accessibility of web content and expand the international reach of the platform.

At the same time, W3C must curate incubation and specification development to meet the continuing needs of rapid technological evolution. With a growing diversity of devices and situations that users access the web for their daily lives, W3C will continue to be the venue where innovators gather to share, critique new ideas, and work towards interoperable solutions users can depend on. The Web platform has become too complex for any individual to grasp fully, or logically analyze, so the omniscient Director model must morph into a scalable decision-making approach.

To do all this, the W3C needs to be a standalone international consortium, no longer hosted by academic institutions, but self-governing and managing its own destiny and infrastructure. We must do this by setting principles and adhering to them:  we must return to our core values, and expand on them.
