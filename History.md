# History of the W3C

How did we get here and where is here?

## History: Inventing the Web Platform - 1995 to 2005
For the first 10 years or so, members of the W3C were working together to invent an open platform that used the internet protocols to share information to all humanity. We figured out what technologies from various existing (often proprietary) systems could be made to work via HTTP, how they might fit together, and which ones really got real world traction. We:

* Chose the best of ideas from early browsers, SGML editors, academic hypertext systems, word-processing products;
* incorporated scripting language support to make it customizable and dynamic;
* incorporated stylesheets to separate content from presentation;
* experimented with ways of integrating Web apps with databases and enterprise applications;
* built a broad community and deep expertise dedicated to ensuring the web is both accessible and international.

By 2005 or so the overall architecture was fairly clear, though curation of the HTML specification had moved to WHATWG. HTTP serving HTML, CSS, DOM, and Javascript became the core technologies for the Web. Other technologies such as XML, RDF, XSLT, Java/VB, and SOAP remain relevant and viable in some (often large) niches and enterprise-scale applications, but have not become part of the core Web platform.

## History: Making the Web Platform Solid, Open, Interoperable - 2006 to 2019
Once the W3C and other open communities had proved the Web's potential, businesses, governments, and users around the world began to depend on it. However, the Web struggled with many of the details:

* under-specified and incompletely-implemented formats and APIs limited interoperability;
* the mobile Web platform took off and created many new technology challenges, but the core web and engines supporting it failed to adapt quickly;
* browser engines and clients evolved rapidly but unevenly;
* entertainment and commerce over-took knowledge creation and sharing as the most common use case for the Web;
* rapid change and business considerations led to confusion about what really was a "standard".

The businesses which depended on the Web generally believed that they spent too much developer time just making their websites work across the range of devices and browsers their customers used. A significant number of major IT, telecom, entertainment, and other businesses have thought it good business to invest in the W3C to help make the Web platform work better. W3C and WHATWG agreed on the curation and publication of HTML.

## The Present: Our Situation
We have treated the Web as only a force for good, and indeed it has catalyzed major social changes. We are proud of the positive changes: e-commerce, publishing, instant access to facts, social engagement, entertainment. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society:

* Its openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud.
* It is too easy to gather personal information, unknown to users: business models that support "free" access to web resources mostly depend on collecting detailed personal information on users without their knowledge, performing exploitive surveillance. The wealth of content funded by these models are a public good; the loss of personal privacy and higher barriers to understanding are not.
* By accelerating the easy exchange of information around the globe, it has enabled misinformation to flourish and be exploited for political or commercial gain;
lack of diversity in participation at the W3C has undoubtedly led to [biases in specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias).

In addition, the successes of the Web don't ensure that members will keep supporting the W3C to perform its functions. Far from there being a need to convince people of the value of the Web, it has become ["too big to fail."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail) The Web is a clear public good, and sometimes suffers from the problem that its maintenance and development are taken as a given, and fewer organizations can economically justify investing their time and expertise in improving the platform for everyone else.

The consortium must become much more conscious of its role, more careful to analyze the unintended effects and consequences of the specifications it publishes, and the technologies they support. We must investigate and address security problems. We must ensure that privacy is universally valued. We must ensure the Web does not favor centralization. The W3C has long unevenly participated in places where regulation and technology meet, and our duty to inform public debate and regulation has expanded: we must establish a forum to discuss and publish technical considerations on social issues. The W3C must look more carefully at our contribution to major challenges facing humanity, particularly sustainable development.  We must be conscious of our constituencies and their priorities, and we must be explicit about the resulting values and principles. We must continue to expand the accessibility of web content and expand the international reach of the platform.

At the same time, W3C must curate incubation and specification development to meet the continuing needs of rapid technological evolution. With a growing diversity of devices and situations that users access the web for their daily lives, W3C will continue to be the venue where innovators gather to share, critique new ideas, and work towards interoperable solutions users can depend on. The Web platform has become too complex for any individual to grasp fully, or logically analyze, so the omniscient Director model must morph into a scalable decision-making approach.

To do all this, the W3C needs to be a standalone international consortium, no longer hosted by academic institutions, but self-governing and managing its own destiny and infrastructure. We must do this by setting principles and adhering to them:  we must return to our core values, and expand on them.
