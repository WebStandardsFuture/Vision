# Origin Sovereignty

__Origin sovereignty__ is the principle according to which the operator of a given Web property
(traditionally listed as the "author" though these operator entities vary widely in nature) should
be the sole and exclusive controller of information pertaining to that Web property (typically a Web
site, often mapped to a domain or origin). Such information covers two primary aspects: the content
that is published on that property, and knowledge of the audience for that domain where the audience
is the set of users who intentionally interacted with that property. Origin sovereignty leads to two
primary considerations for how the Web must work:

* The Web must be defined on the assumption that in the vast majority of cases the content published
  by one Web property should stay with that property and does not need to be aggregated or
  republished elsewhere, nor does it need to be integrated into a portal. The Web is built on a
  foundation of hyperlinking, and it is architecturally dubious to uproot content from its origin in
  order to provide it in a different context.
* The Web is built on the expectation that information about the online behaviour of users as it
  takes place on a given Web property, being the property that users intended to interact with, must
  remain under the exclusive control of that property's operator, which alone must determine the
  means and purposes of its processing. Where that property's operator works with third parties,
  those third parties must only ever be service providers to that operator and must not be able to
  independently reuse data obtained from providing their service. No other monitoring on online
  behaviour is compatible with the well-being of the Web.

These considerations ensure that website publishers can operate a business without unfair
competition from other parties that can impose tracking, force their content into aggregated
experiences, or rely on their control of infrastructure such as operating systems, ad serving, online
portals, or user agents to unfairly extract knowledge about others' audiences.

Exceptions can be considered to sovereignty when legitimate systems of collective governance exist
that can support the common good (eg. a data trust of appropriately anonymised online behaviour in
support of greater end-user security).
