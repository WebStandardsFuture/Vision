# Origin Sovereignty

Origin sovereignty is the principle according to which the operator of a given domain should be the
sole and exclusive controller of information pertaining to that domain. This information covers two
primary aspects: the content that is published on that origin, and knowledge of the audience for
that domain. This correspondingly leads to two primary considerations for how the Web must work:

* The Web must be defined so that content published by one origin stays with that origin and does
  not get aggregated or republished elsewhere. The Web is built on the back of hyperlinking, and
  it is architecturally dubious to uproot content from its origin in order to provide it in a
  different context.
* The Web is built on the expectation that information about the online behaviour of users as it
  takes place on a given origin must remain under the exclusive control of that origin's operator,
  which alone must determine the means and purposes of its processing. Where that origin's operator
  works with third parties, those third parties must only ever be service providers to that operator
  and must not be able to independently reuse data obtained from providing that service. No other
  monitoring on online behaviour is compatible with the well-being of the Web.

These considerations ensure that the website publishers can operate a business without unfair
competition from other parties that can impose tracking, force their content into aggregated
experiences, or rely on user agents to unfairly extract knowledge of audiences.

Exceptions can be considered to sovereignty when legitimate systems of collective governance exist
that can support the common good (eg. a data trust of appropriately anonymised online behaviour in
support of greater end-user security).
